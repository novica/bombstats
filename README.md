Future work moved to https://github.com/skopjehacklab/bombstats
This repo is not maintained.

A simple page to track some simple stats about Macedonia's political bombshells

TODO
- create index.html that links to other tables / presentation of data
- pages with stats:
- number of people appearing in recordings
- freqeuncy of people
- frequency of pairs
- maybe add d3.js to the repo instead of linkink
- fix any typos in names
- check if all pairs are correct (peer review?)
- divide April 18th and 19th recordings per day
